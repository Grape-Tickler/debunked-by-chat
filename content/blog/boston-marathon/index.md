## Background

* [/r/braveryjerk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Braveryjerk/) is a subreddit dedicated to mocking Redditors who make controversial/edgy posts in the vein of it being a "brave" opinion.
* Over 12 years ago, when the h3h3Productions channel had just 4k subscribers, Ethan made a video to be posted on the subreddit. In the video, Ethan was mocking people who had "brave" opinions on the Boston Marathon Bombing victims.
* [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/22wjk1/boston_marathon_bombing_survivors_return_to/?sort=controversial) was one of the main examples. You can see that the controversial comments are quite inflammatory and disturbing. [1](https://imgur.com/a/csoJsn2)

## Lie

* Ethan sexually harassed a Boston Marathon victim who was a minor.

## Truth

* Ethan made a crass video mocking "edgy" people on the internet that were making inappropriate jokes. In the video, he visibly has flour on his nose to pretend it is a coke fueled rant, further emphasizing the satirical nature of the video.
* Ethan took down the video in 2016 and apologized publicly multiple times for the incident. [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvO4Q5Nc8wY&t=9410s)
* The young woman in the picture is not a minor. You can view the caption of the article this image was pulled from to see that she was 18 at the time of the picture [3](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tasneemnashrulla/xx-inspiring-messages-from-the-boston-marathon-survivors-to). Another article corroborates that she was 18 while she was in the hospital [4](https://www.lowellsun.com/2013/04/24/from-one-victim-to-another-happy-birthday/).

## Conclusion

* Ethan made a very offensive commentary video 12 years ago. His intent was mocking people that were seriously making these disgusting comments. In the video, he lampooned comments that were being made towards a specific photo of a victim that was posted on Reddit. He apologized for it and took the video down in 2016. The girl in the picture was not a minor.
