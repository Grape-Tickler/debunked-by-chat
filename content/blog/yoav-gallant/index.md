Hila's Comment About Yoav Gallant

## Background

* On November 5th, 2024 Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced that he's firing Yoav Gallant, the defense minister at the time.[1](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/05/middleeast/netanyahu-yoav-gallant-intl-latam/)

* The reason for the firing was because Yoav Gallant advocated for the end of the IDF in Gaza. [2](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/07/yoav-gallant-israel-army-nothing-left-to-do-in-gaza)

* On November 6th, 2024 Donald Trump was elected president of the United States.[3](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/donald-trump-elected-47th-president-of-the-united-states)

  
## Lie

Hila praised Yoav Gallant's character while knowing his role in the violence against the Palestinians.


## Truth

* During a discussion about Donald Trump’s stance on Israel, Hila noted that Netanyahu fired Yoav Gallant after they had disagreements about whether the IDF should have a presence in Gaza.
* Hila compared that situation to Trump’s habit of dismissing officials who disagree with him. She described Gallant as a "really good guy", and Ethan added that they’d read he’s regarded as a "moderating voice" in the conflict, which supports her view.

- Ethan and Hila publish a video clarifying their comments [5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=telKFaTvQqU) :
    - Ethan denounces Gallant's use of dehumanizing and genocidal language towards the Palestinians.
    - Ethan advocates for Gallant's actions to be investigated by the international criminal courts.
    - Hila apologizes for describing Yoav Gallant as a good guy, calling it a poor choice of words. She further clarifies that her comments were out of frustration for losing a voice that advocated to end the conflict.
    - Hila announces that she's stepping away from the show for the near future.

## Conclusion

Hila made a poorly phrased statement saying that Yoav was a "good guy". She meant that his stance against the conflict made him a moderating voice compared to Netanyahu. The crux of her statement was that she wanted more people advocating against a conflict in Palestine.
