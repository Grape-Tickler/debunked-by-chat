title: Hila’s Alleged Denial of IDF Violence
description: "Did Hila deny that the IDF was killing innocent Palestinian civilians and children?"
---

## Background

* On October 7th, 2023 a series of attacks were carried out by Hamas in Southern Israel, resulting in over 1,000 casualties. [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_7_attacks)
* Two days after the attacks, the H3 Podcast went live with the episode titled "[i made a mistake. i'm sorry. - H3TV #93](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNFeRPMOu8g)". The episode included an over hour-long chapter of Ethan and Hila talking about the attacks.
* Several countries worldwide have designated Hamas as a terrorist organization. [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas)


## Myth

* During their discussion about the October 7th attacks, Hila interjected by stating that she does in fact deny that. She was quoted as saying "I am, I am denying that". [[3]](https://www.reddit.com/r/h3snark/comments/1749jmg/hila_klein_i_am_im_denying_that/)

## Reality

* During their discussion, Ethan was talking about Hamas and rejecting the notion that they are "Freedom Fighters" while also calling them terrorists who target civilians.[[4]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNFeRPMOu8g&t=5725) Hila interjected by repeating a comment from a chatter saying that "Israel does *that* on the daily". Ethan interrupted Hila, causing the conversation to split into two parallel interpretations:
   * Ethan, continuing his train of thought, addressed the comment as "Israel also kills innocent civilians and children on the daily" which he stated he doesn't deny.
   * Hila, wanting to express her original thought before Ethan interrupted her, addressed the comment as "Israel does October 7th scale killings on the daily" which, at the time, was incorrect.

* This is supported just 10 minutes later in the same episode when a chatter commented that "Palestinian children are dying right now too" and Hila responded "Yeah, and I wouldn't celebrate that". [[5]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNFeRPMOu8g&t=6403) This directly contradicts the claims that Hila denies the IDF killing children.

* This is further supported by Hila's explanation on the October 31st members' stream titled "[Responding to hila conspiracy theories - See You Next Tuesday #50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O86fRRS3I1g)", where Hila stated the following:

   > "What was being said is that after October 7th, the horrors that happened on October 7th... they are saying *(referring to the chatter)* that the IDF does that on the daily, I am denying that"

## Conclusion

* Hila was misquoted by bad actors as saying "I am denying that" regarding the IDF's violence against innocents.
* In reality, Hila was denying the scale of the violence, which people were falsely comparing to the October 7th attacks. At the time, this was often done to dismiss people's concern over the attacks.
