title: Ethan killed his Dog
description: "Did Ethan kill Shredder with cheese?"
---

## Background

* Ethan and Hila had a small Yorkie named Shredder.
* Shredder died of chronic kidney failure at 6 years old.
* Veterinarians were unable to identify the underlying cause, leaving Ethan confused and searching for answers.
* In one clip, he expressed regret that he sometimes sprinkled cheese on Shredder’s food.

## Snark

* Ethan is an irresponsible dog owner who killed Shredder by feeding him too much cheese.

## Truth

* Cheese is non-toxic to dogs, and even in large quantities is not known to cause kidney disease.
* Ethan only added very small sprinkles of cheese on top of Shredder’s regular dog food, specifically to help him eat because he was a picky eater, under his vet's instruction.
* Shredder was regularly examined by multiple veterinarians, and Ethan brought up concerns repeatedly. These concerns were often dismissed or attributed to common small-breed issues.
* Chronic kidney disease in small and toy breeds, especially Yorkies, is most often genetic or congenital and typically goes undetected until late stages, even with routine vet visits.
* Ethan's other dogs were also tested and presented no issues despite having similar diets.
* After diagnosis, Ethan and Hila pursued second and third opinions, specialist consultations, medications, fluids, diet changes, and every available treatment option.
* More details in this video.


## Conclusion

* The “cheese clip” was Ethan’s emotional attempt to understand a sudden, heartbreaking diagnosis, not evidence of wrongdoing. Shredder almost certanly died of an unfortunate genetic inevitability.
